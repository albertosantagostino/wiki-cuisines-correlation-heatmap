# Wikipedia cuisines (cooking cultures) correlation heatmap

This project aims to obtain a [heatmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) between different languages Wikipedias and the length of [cuisines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine) pages

### Mmmh... What?

The idea is to obtain a table with the different cuisines (e.g.: Chinese cuisine, Italian cuisine, Indian cuisine...) on the rows and the different languages in which these voices can be found on Wikipedia on the columns

Every cell represents graphically and numerically the **length of the page** in that specific language

### Why?

* To have an idea of the interest for different cooking cultures around the world!  
  (I'm not saying that the length of a Wikipedia page reflects how much a country is interested in a specific foreign cuisine, but it's an indicator that can be taken into account, at least to do some really simple observation)

* To find some unexpected correlation, for example:  
  _"It seems that South-American country X seems to be really interested in cuisines from Asiatic country Y but seems that has a little regarding cuisine from Z"_

* Most importantly to have a framework ready to perform similar analysis in the future

* Because heatmaps are [really nice to look at](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=heatmap+correlation+colored&iax=images&ia=images)!
